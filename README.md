# Analyzing-Customer-Financial-Data

This repository contains various data analysis projects that I have worked on. 

Project 1: Credit Card Loan Acceptance Prediction 
In this project, I built a classification model to predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer based on their financial information. 
The dataset used was provided by a bank, and the analysis techniques used included feature selection, logistic regression, and performance evaluation using accuracy and
F1-score metrics. The results showed that including the new feature of total income did not improve the model's performance, and it is suggested to consider the trade-off between model performance and complexity when deciding which features to include in the model.


Project 2: Customer Income Prediction 
This project involved building a regression model to predict a customer's income based on their demographic and financial 
information. Two models were built, one using linear regression and the other using polynomial regression. The analysis techniques used included feature selection, 
model evaluation using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and AIC. The results showed that the polynomial regression model performed better than the linear 
regression model. This analysis can be useful for financial institutions and companies to predict a customer's potential income and tailor their marketing strategies or
financial products accordingly.



Project 3: Customer Segmentation 
In this project, clustering analysis was used to group customers based on their demographic and financial information.
The dataset used included features such as age, income, and education level. The analysis techniques used included K-means clustering and principal component analysis
(PCA). The results showed that education was not a major differentiator between the clusters, with the majority of customers in all three clusters having education
levels of 1 or 2. Additionally, Cluster 0 represented the highest socio-economic group with the highest education and income levels, Cluster 1 represented the lowest
socio-economic group with the lowest education and income levels, while Cluster 2 represented the middle-class socio-economic group with moderate education and income
levels. This analysis can help financial institutions and companies to better understand their customer base and tailor their financial products and services accordingly.
